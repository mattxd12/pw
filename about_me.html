    <h1 class="heading"><br>A Little Background</h1>
      <p class= "para"> Hey! I'm Matt and I'm 27 years old. I grew up in Foxboro, MA (home of the Patriots) and went to Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, CT where I majored in Accounting and Finance. After graduation I moved to Boston for a couple of years where I worked as a real estate agent. Seeking some adventure and change, my girlfriend Rachel and I took a 15 day roadtrip across the country to Denver, CO. I took a job with Empower Retirement (formerly Great-West) in Greenwood Village, where I spent the last two years as an Issue Resolution Specialist.

    <h1 class="heading">Family</h1>
      <p class= "para">I have an older sister and two younger brothers. My brother Keith is currenty living in San Diego, CA and his twin brother Mike, my sister Kristie and both of my parents are living in Boston. Rachel and I have a dog, Rue, that we got from a shelter in Maine and also made the cross country road trip with us.

    <h1 class="heading">Hobbies</h1>
      <p class= "para">I love the outdoors and since moving here, I've become addicted to snowboarding. We bought the Epic Local Pass the first two winters out here and recently switched to the Rocky Mountain Pass for the 2016-2017 season. We've gone hiking and camping to so many beautiful places already and we have only scratched the surface of our very long destination list. I'm a huge Patriots fan and when I'm not on the mountains, I spend a lot of my time following the stock markets and researching publicly traded companies. I also enjoy building things and I'm very excited to apply programming to that hobby.
