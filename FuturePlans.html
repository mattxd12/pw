      <h1 class="heading">Short Term Goals</h1>
      <br>
        <p class= "para"> I have always had a passion for technology and once introduced to the Codecademy's interactive platform and free courses, I knew this is what I wanted to do. I don't want to completely leave the finance world, but I will ideally be able to find a role that combines them. Building an integrated web-site for stock charting and research has always been a goal of mine and I plan on pursuing that as more of a hobby after graduation. I also would love to build an app for my sisters real-estate company, Presidential Properties, as well as being able to assist her with any technical issues she encounters.
        </p>

      <h1 class="heading">The End Game</h1>
      <br>
        <p class= "para">Overall, I am not positive where this journey will take me, but I know the skills I will learn at Galvanize will be invaluable where ever I end up. I hope to get a full-time position shortly after graduation in a programming role where I will be able to further fine tune the skills I learned at Galvanize. I'm not sure what type of role I will go for as of now, but I'm looking forward to the process of figuring that out. The end goal is to start and operate my own company and the programming skills I learn at Galvanize will most definitely give me a competitive advantage.
          <br><br><br>

      <p class= "para"> I'm very excited to start the Galvanize program and look forward to getting to know the instructors and my fellow classmates!
